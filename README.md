# Code based introduction to the haskell

Use this if you prefer to read code to get started with a language.

NOTE: Meant to be a quick hacky intro to the language , not comprehensive in any sense. Assumes programming knowlege.

Getting started:
- Install haskell - https://www.haskell.org/downloads
- Read haskell.hs and follow instructions. Check value of variables and run functions one by one.
